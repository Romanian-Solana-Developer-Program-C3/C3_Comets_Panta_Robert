## Q&A

| Questions   | Answers                  |
|:---------:|:-----------------------:|
| 1. Does the anchor project compile without any warnings?  | **No, the Anchor project does not compile without warnings. The output shows several warnings related to unexpected cfg condition values (such as custom-heap, solana, anchor-debug, etc.), which are caused by configuration mismatches or outdated dependencies.**               |
| 2. What is the name of the instruction handler?  | **In an Anchor program, the instruction handler is typically the function marked with the #[instruction] attribute or defined as part of the #[program] macro. For the project structure, the instruction handler is in the lib.rs file under favorites/programs/src/ directory; therefore, initialize is the instruction handler.**           |
| 3. The program has an ID, which is a pubkey. Where does the secret key for this pubkey exist? Hint: it's in your project. | **The secret key for this program ID (the private key corresponding to the public key) is stored in a specific file in the project, more exactly in the /target/deploy directory.**           |
